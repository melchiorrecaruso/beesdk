This is BeeOpt 1.7.1 utility (C) 1999-2002 Andrew Filinsky
      for Bee 0.7.x archiver (C) 1999-2002 Andrew Filinsky.

USAGE:
            BeeOpt <Ext> [<Options>]

<Ext>
            is the name of folder, which contains a set of
            typical files with <Ext> extension. This files will
            be used for parameters optimization.

<Options> is:

        -cfg<Name>
            Use specified configuration file.
            By default will use "<Ext>.Dat" parameters file and
            "Bee.Ini" configuration file.

        -c
            Collect configuration files from current folder
            and its subfolders, then place they into
            configuration file into current folder, without
            duplicates.

        -recalculate
            Recalculate parameters for start new optimization
            session at next running of BeeOpt.

        -merge
            Collect all <Ext>.dat files in subfolders to one <Ext>.dat, 
            and prepare it to recalculate.

For optimization of parameters the <Ext> subfolder must
be created, in which the set of typical files must be
placed. Total size of files must be at least 1 mbyte.

Then you can start BeeOpt, using <Ext> as parameter.
The result of optimization will be placed in Bee.Ini
file.

At last, you can construct configuration file for Bee
0.7.x, by starting BeeOpt with an option "-c". Send
constructed configuration files to e-mail:

            filinsky@mail.ru,

then Yours configuration files will be used for reception
of the better compression ratio by the Bee 0.7.x.

EXAMPLES:

      Create parameters for *.Doc files. "Doc" subfolder
      with set of *.Doc files inside must be previously
      created:

            BeeOpt Doc

      Create parameters for *.* files. "Default" folder with
      set of different files inside must be previously
      created:

            BeeOpt Default

      Construct configuration file "Bee.Ini" for Bee 0.7.x:

            BeeOpt -c
